{"name":"Myrecipes","tagline":"Main project of Udemy Ruby on Rails course","body":"### Welcome to my little side-project\r\nThis is a website created using Ruby on Rails, a website application framework, for back-end codes and HTML and JavaScript for front-end codes. On this website, you can create your own \"chef\" profile, log in with secure authentication and post your favorite cooking recipes. Furthermore, you can view other chefs' recipes, vote and comment on the recipe you like. \r\nThis is a project from Udemy's Rails course I took over the Summer (June 2015 to July 2015). This course is one more step for me to explore web development field, and I enjoy building and playing around with the website. I like coding with Rails since it is more convenient to pick up and learn; I am able to write simpler and maintainable code with it. Besides, Rails makes it easy to add nice feature to application due to the rich amount of gems (add-on) and tutorials.\r\n\r\nLink to the website: [My Recipe Apps](https://myrecipeonrails.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
